    <h1 id="Q1">Multilingual Youth</h1>
    <p>I would encourage our youth to learn as many foreign languages as possible. But prior to that ambitious goal, they all should know their own language - Azeri. They should feel it as a mother language and be able to think in it. I wish for the day when our youth can read Shakespeare in English, Pushkin in Russian, and our own Azerbaijani poets - Nizami, Fuzuli and Nasimi - in Azerbaijani.</p>
    <p>Heydar Aliyev, Azerbaijan's President, in a televised forum on "Youth" in Baku on February 2, 1996.</p>

    <h1 id="Q2">Democracy is not an Apple</h1>
    <p>Some people think we should be able to establish democracy in a short time, but that's impossible. Azerbaijan is a young nation and democracy is a new concept. The U.S. has been advancing on the path of democracy for a long time - more than 200 years. You've achieved a lot, but you're still working on it. Democracy is not an apple you buy at the market and bring back home.</p>
    <p>Heydar Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan, on his first official visit to the United States, speaking at an Open Forum sponsored by the US-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce (USACC) at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. on July 30, 1997.</p>

    <h1 id="Q3">Patience has its Limits</h1>
    <p>We want peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan. We want peace in the Caucasus region. We want peace in Southern Caucasus. And, therefore, we are putting up with this difficult situation. But patience has its limits. You should know, the entire OSCE should know, the Minsk Group should know and the United Nations should know that an end must be put to this injustice against Azerbaijan.</p>
    <p>President Heydar Aliyev addressing the visiting OSCE delegation headed by the chair, Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner, on July 18, 2000 in Baku.</p>

    <h1 id="Q4">International Policy - The Right Way</h1>
    <p>You can't be friends with some countries and enemies with others, despite the fact that this is the way most countries function. You have to take into consideration the special interests of each country. Azerbaijan doesn't want to be enemies with any country. At the same time, we will not become victim to another country's policies. We have our own independent policy. As well, we are developing good relations with Europe and America and seek to benefit from their experiences, while preserving our own national identity and our own resources. Future leaders must pursue the policy that I have put in place. If they do, then they will succeed. If not, then Azerbaijan will face enormous tragedy.</p>
    <p>Heydar Aliyev (May 10, 1923-December 12, 2003) who served as President of Azerbaijan (1993-2003) in an interview with Azerbaijan International's editor, Betty Blair, in 1999 when asked what advice he would give to future leaders of Azerbaijan in the 21st century in regard to foreign policy, given that Azerbaijan was a small country surrounded by Russia, Iran, Armenia, Turkey and Georgia?</p>
